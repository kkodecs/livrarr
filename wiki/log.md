# Wiki Change Log

## 2026-04-19 — Compile wall 100% second review pass

**Updated pages:**
- insights.md — added 9g (handler-level spawning for background work)

**Context:** Independent consult found one uncaptured pattern: handlers are the only layer that can clone AppContext and tokio::spawn, because services only have `&self`. Three instances in work.rs (add→bibliography, refresh_all→bulk loop, author_search→monitor). Complement to 9d — 9d is for when services must hold state, 9g is the default for everything else.

## 2026-04-19 — Compile wall 100% post-session review

**Updated pages:**
- insights.md — amended 9e (WorkId/UserId are domain-native, not banned), added 9f (accessor newtype wrappers for orphan rule)

**Context:** Cross-agent review of compile-wall-100pct session. 2 of 6 independent agents identified the orphan-rule accessor pattern as the top uncaptured insight (6 wrappers in state.rs). 9e was corrected — prior version implied WorkId/UserId were banned livrarr-db types, but they're defined in livrarr-domain.

## 2026-04-19 — Compile wall 100% wiki consult

**Updated pages:**
- insights.md — added trait signature type safety rule (9e)

**Context:** Reviewed all session artifacts from 100% handler extraction. Both cross-family reviewers (Gemini + GPT) independently flagged P0 that service trait signatures are the compile wall's transitive boundary. The banned-types audit and substitution map from the plan were not yet captured in insights. Other patterns (Arc, OnceLock, orphan-rule wrappers) either already captured or derivable from code.

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 5 compile wall documentation

**Updated pages:**
- architecture/overview.md — added livrarr-handlers crate, compile wall section, Arc<ServiceImpl> pattern, renamed livrarr-organize → livrarr-library, added livrarr-matching crate
- insights.md — updated crate count to 11, added compile wall insight (9b), added Arc service pattern insight (9c)

**Context:** Phase 5 extracted all 40 route handlers from livrarr-server to livrarr-handlers behind a compile wall. The wiki previously didn't document this crate, the AppContext pattern, or the service wiring conventions.

- insights.md — added OnceLock<Box<AppState>> circular dep pattern (9d)

## 2026-04-18 — Full ingest from build artifacts

Processed all 17 specs chronologically (v2 through consolidation), 4 policies, cross-cutting decisions, and 3 build analyses. Later specs overwrote earlier knowledge per conflict rules.

**New pages (9):**
- domain/release.md — transient search results, protocol routing
- domain/series.md — Goodreads-sourced series, monitoring, assignment
- domain/list.md — bulk import mechanism
- domain/metadata-sources.md — all providers, foreign language pipeline, gotchas
- architecture/rss-sync.md — automated matching, gap detection
- architecture/usenet-pipeline.md — SABnzbd integration
- architecture/import-pipeline.md — detailed scan → tag → track flow
- architecture/ui-architecture.md — React stack, Readarr mimicry
- patterns/migration-pattern.md — SQLite migration rules

**Updated pages (4):**
- insights.md — expanded to 28 items, added cross-references to wiki pages
- index.md — added all new pages
- architecture/enrichment-pipeline.md — enrichment modes detail from consolidation spec
- domain/work.md — per-media-type monitoring detail

**Sources:** spec-librarr-v2.md through spec-consolidation.md (17 specs), 4 policy files, cross-cutting-decisions.md, 3 build analyses

## 2026-04-18 — Initial wiki scaffold

- Initial wiki scaffold created (17 pages)
- Ingested domain knowledge from high-level build artifact review
